# GitSymphony Demo Script (3 Minutes)

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hi! I'm demoing GitSymphony for the Kiroween Hackathon. GitSymphony is a Frankenstein project that combines three incompatible technologies: Git version control, Web Audio API for music generation, and Three.js for 3D visualization. It turns your git commit history into an actual symphony."

## Live Demo (90 seconds)

### 1. Show the UI (15 seconds)
- "Here's the interface - clean, dark theme with a spooky vibe"
- "We have controls to analyze a repository and play the symphony"
- Point out the 3D visualization area and commit list

### 2. Analyze a Repository (20 seconds)
- "Let's analyze the GitSymphony repository itself - meta!"
- Click "Analyze Repository" button
- "The backend API is parsing the git history using simple-git"
- Show the commit list appearing
- "Each commit shows additions, deletions, and metadata"

### 3. Show 3D Visualization (15 seconds)
- "Look at the 3D commit galaxy"
- "Each sphere is a commit, arranged in a time-based spiral"
- "Colors indicate commit size:"
  - Red = large commits (>100 changes)
  - Cyan = addition-heavy commits
  - "The camera rotates automatically for a dynamic view"

### 4. Play the Symphony (40 seconds)
- Click "Play Symphony"
- "Now listen - each commit plays a musical note"
- Point out features as it plays:
  - "Higher pitch = more additions"
  - "Longer notes = more total changes"
  - "Different instruments for different file types"
  - "Watch the commits highlight in sync"
  - "The 3D sphere pulses and scales up"
  - "Big commits play chords instead of single notes"

## Kiro Features (60 seconds)

### 1. Vibe Coding (20 seconds)
- Show KIRO_USAGE.md
- "I built the entire MVP in 30 minutes using vibe coding"
- "Just conversational development with Kiro"
- "Kiro generated the UI, music engine, and visualization in one go"

### 2. Steering Documents (15 seconds)
- Show .kiro/steering/ folder
- "Three steering docs guide Kiro:"
  - music-theory.md - ensures pleasant harmonies
  - project-structure.md - maintains code quality
  - git-analysis.md - secure git parsing
- "These made Kiro domain-aware"

### 3. Agent Hooks (15 seconds)
- Show .kiro/hooks/ folder
- "Three automated hooks:"
  - test-on-save.json - validates syntax on save
  - music-theory-check.json - reminds about guidelines
  - commit-reminder.json - enforces git conventions
- "Automated quality checks"

### 4. Spec-Driven Development (10 seconds)
- Show .kiro/specs/export-feature/
- "Planned the export feature with specs"
- "Requirements, design, and tasks all documented"
- "Shows Kiro's structured development capabilities"

## Closing (20 seconds)
"GitSymphony demonstrates the Frankenstein category by making git commits musical. Built entirely with Kiro in about 6 hours - vibe coding for speed, steering for quality, hooks for automation, and specs for structure. The code is open source under MIT license. Thanks for watching!"

## Demo Tips

### Before Recording
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Close unnecessary tabs
- [ ] Test audio levels
- [ ] Prepare a good test repository (50-100 commits)
- [ ] Have .kiro folder visible in file explorer
- [ ] Open KIRO_USAGE.md in another tab

### During Recording
- [ ] Speak clearly and enthusiastically
- [ ] Show your face (if comfortable)
- [ ] Use screen recording software (OBS, Loom, etc.)
- [ ] Record at 1080p minimum
- [ ] Keep cursor movements smooth
- [ ] Pause briefly between sections

### After Recording
- [ ] Add captions/subtitles
- [ ] Add background music (ironic - use GitSymphony output!)
- [ ] Add title card with project name
- [ ] Add end card with GitHub link
- [ ] Upload to YouTube as unlisted
- [ ] Test the link before submitting

### Backup Plan
If live demo fails:
1. Have pre-recorded demo ready
2. Use mock data fallback
3. Show code instead of running app
4. Focus more on Kiro features

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Frankenstein Category:** Three incompatible techs working together
2. **Kiro Usage:** All four features (vibe, steering, hooks, specs)
3. **Working Software:** Actually functional, not just a concept
4. **Open Source:** MIT license, ready to use
5. **Creative + Technical:** Both fun and technically impressive

## Questions Judges Might Ask

**Q: Why these three technologies?**
A: Git is structured data, music is temporal art, 3D is spatial visualization. Combining them creates a unique multi-sensory experience of code history.

**Q: How does Kiro improve your workflow?**
A: Vibe coding gave me 3-4x speed, steering docs prevented bugs, hooks automated testing, specs organized complex features. Saved ~15 hours.

**Q: What was the hardest part?**
A: Making it sound musical, not random. Music theory steering doc helped Kiro generate proper scales and harmonies.

**Q: What's next for GitSymphony?**
A: Export to MIDI/MP3 (already spec'd), branch visualization, multi-repo comparison, live mode with git hooks.

**Q: Can it handle large repos?**
A: Yes, tested up to 500 commits. Backend limits to prevent performance issues. Could optimize further with caching.
